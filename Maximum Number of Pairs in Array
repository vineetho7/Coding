You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.
The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.


class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums) {

        map<int,int>m;
        int pa=0;
        int lo =0;
        for(auto i:nums){
            m[i]++;
        }
        for(auto i:m){
            pa+=i.second/2;
            lo+=i.second%2;

            
        }
        return {pa,lo};
        
    }
};
