You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int ans=0;
        int i=0;
        int j=height.size()-1;

        while(i<j){

            if(height[i]<height[j]){
                ans = max(ans,abs(i-j)*height[i]);
                i++;

            }
            else{
                ans = max(ans,abs(i-j)*height[j]);
                j--;
