You have n processes forming a rooted tree structure. You are given two integer arrays pid and ppid, where pid[i] is the ID of the ith process and ppid[i] is the ID of the ith process's parent process.

Each process has only one parent process but may have multiple children processes. Only one process has ppid[i] = 0, which means this process has no parent process (the root of the tree).

When a process is killed, all of its children processes will also be killed.

Given an integer kill representing the ID of a process you want to kill, return a list of the IDs of the processes that will be killed. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: pid = [1,3,10,5], ppid = [3,0,5,3], kill = 5
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The processes colored in red are the processes that should be killed.
Example 2:

Input: pid = [1], ppid = [0], kill = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

n == pid.length
n == ppid.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= pid[i] <= 5 * 104
0 <= ppid[i] <= 5 * 104
Only one process has no parent.
All the values of pid are unique.
kill is guaranteed to be in pid.

        }
        queue<int> f;
        f.push(kill);
        ans.push_back(kill);
        while(!f.empty()){
        
        vector<int>c=m[f.front()];
        f.pop();
        

            for(auto i: c){
            ans.push_back(i);
            f.push(i);
            }

            //ans.push_back(m[f]);
            //f=m[f];
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
