Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
Example 2:

Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".

class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        for(int i=0;i<word.size();i++){
            if(word[i]==ch){
                cout<<i<<endl;
                int l=0;int r=i;
                while(l<r){
                    swap(word[l],word[r]);
                    l++;
                    r--;
                }
                break;
            }
        }
        return word;
    }
};
