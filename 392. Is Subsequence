Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int tn=t.size();
        int sn=s.size();
        int j=0;
        if(s=="")return true;
        for(int i=0;i<tn;i++){
            if(s[j]==t[i]){
                //cout<<"j"<<j<<"i"<<i<<endl;
                j++;
            }
            if(j!=0 && j==sn){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
        
    }
};
