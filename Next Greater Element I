The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {

        

        int n= nums1.size();
        int mm=nums2.size();
        map<int,int>m;
        stack<int>s;

        for(int i=mm-1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!s.empty()&&s.top()<=nums2[i]){
                s.pop();
            }
            if(s.empty()){
                m[nums2[i]]=-1;
            }
            else{
                m[nums2[i]]=s.top();
            }
            s.push(nums2[i]);
        }
        vector<int>res;
        for(int i=0;i<nums1.size();i++){
            res.push_back(m[nums1[i]]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
